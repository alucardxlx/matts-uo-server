Instructions:

To get NecroMageAI to work you will have to make two quick changes.  Or you can change the few mobs that use it to whatever else you please.

The 2 changes are as follows:

Open BaseAI.cs  Right at the top you will see

public enum AIType
	{
		AI_Use_Default,
		AI_Melee,
		AI_Animal,
		AI_Archer,
		AI_Healer,
		AI_Vendor,
		AI_Mage,
		AI_Berserk,
		AI_Predator,
		AI_Thief

Add a comma after AI_Thief and below that insert AI_NecroMage  (No comma after that one)

Then in BaseCreature.cs search for case AIType.AI_Necro:  which should bring up a section that looks like this:

case AIType.AI_Mage:
                    m_AI = new MageAI(this);
                    break;
                case AIType.AI_Predator:
                    //m_AI = new PredatorAI(this);
                    m_AI = new MeleeAI(this);
                    break;
                case AIType.AI_Thief:
                    m_AI = new ThiefAI(this);
                    break;

After the last case, add

		case AIType.AI_NecroMage:
                    m_AI = new NecroMageAI(this);
                    break;

That will allow the NecroMageAI to function.

Training and Recruit weapons:

If you are using Mondains Legacy you will need to edit one line in each of the 8 weapons.  Just find this line:

		//public override float MlSpeed{ get{ return 4.25f; } }
(Should be right about line 24)  and uncomment (take out the two //'s at the begining.  If you do not do this, the weapons will not attack.

To add/change items that thevendor sells open SMMeleeTrainer.cs.
Just add a new line for additional goods or change one already there.  

Add(new GenericBuyInfo(typeof(EnhancedBandage), 2, 200, 0xE21, 0));
The "EnhancedBandage" part is the Proper name (If you type [add bandage that is what you will put there.)  The next number, (2 in our example) is the cost of the item.  Next (the 200 in the example) is how many he stocks, the 3rd number (0XE21 in the example) is the ItemID of the item and the final number is the Hue  (Ive not had any luck Hueing items for sale on vendor so I just leave it blank.)

Changing gate open coords and destination coords.

ReadyGate line 32, you will see this: ( new Point3D( 3712, 2229, 20  ), Map.Felucca )   Changing the 3712, 2229, 20 changes where the gate opens at.  Make sure to modify the map as well.

ReadyGump line 66, you will see this: (new Point3D( 5155, 1433, 0 ), Map.Trammel)
Changing this will change the destination of the gate.  Make sure to modify the map.
